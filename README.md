# BibCreator
JavaScript Object Notation or JSON is a well-known, lightweight data-interchange format, which is easily readable/writable by humans. It is also easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON is based on data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs and array data types. It is widely used for asynchronous browser–server communication, including as a replacement for XML in some AJAX-style systems. As such, many journals and scientific servers are supporting this format. This format is easily extendable. The following is a typical sample (modified form an existing IEEE paper). This is an alternative tool (to the existing ones), called BibCreator. The main task of this tool is read and process a given .bib file (which has one or more articles) and create 3 different files with the correct reference formats for IEEE, ACM and NJ.
